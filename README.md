# Tic-tac-toe

(https://kiraamaa.github.io/tic-tac-toe-project/)

## Technologies Used

-   Javascript
-   HTML
-   CSS
-   Tic-tac-toe API

## Development Process

1. Research game requirements and technologies.
2. Create wireframes for game website using Sketch.
3. Write out user stories for game.
4. Craft a list of necessary parts.
5. Devise a version control workflow:
-   Branch large-scope features such as 'front-end' or 'back-end' off of 'master', and then branch smaller feature branches off of those.
-   Begin coding.
-   Revisit list of necessary parts needed.
6. Revise version control workflow:
-   Create a 'development' branch and for each feature make a single branch off of it, then merge that branch back into 'development'. -   Finally, merge back into 'master'. Also, create a 'to-do' list that is added to when coding and coming across issues or thinking of ideas, so that the focus is only on one problem at a time.
7. Revise code, spending time focusing on the requirements as opposed to interesting problems that are unimportant.
8. Once code is in a 'near-production' state, spend time working on testing as many possible use-cases as possible.
9. Once satisfied with completion of tests, remove all debugger, console.log, and other WIP code.
10. Deploy finalized project to GitHub Pages and test functionality again.
11. Write README file based off of notes.
12. Push final README to 'master' branch.

## Next Steps

All of my gameplay logic and API calls work, and I surprisingly don't have any remaining bugs (or any that I know about after user-testing 150+ games). If I had more time I would make better user-facing messages and refine the color scheme, condense my code and eliminate redundancies, make better modals that pop up on page load, and re-organize my JS files so that my concerns were better differentiated.
