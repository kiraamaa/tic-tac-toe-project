## Development Process

I initially set out with a registration modal template I found using Sketch, a UX wireframing software. I wanted to learn the software, so I took it upon myself to make some more polished wireframes so that I would have something ambitious to work towards. I knew what format and color scheme I wanted to work with from the outset, and was able to at least recreate this.

I began with the HTML/CSS and attempted to render multiple modals that showed up on page load, without having to click buttons, but quickly realized that it would be too difficult and hinder me from working on the game logic. I decided to focus on making modals appear using the Bootstrap navbar, and finalized the design of the navbar itself. I then worked on the API authorization, and once I was able to complete that worked on the game logic with a classmate. I found it was incredibly productive to work with another person, and we were able to accomplish a great deal more in a shorter period of time. I troubleshooted as I went, and found several user-facing bugs that took some time to fix but were ultimately resolved. I finalized everything by linking the API authorization to the game logic via an event handler, so that the user had to sign up and sign in before being allowed to play. The final step was simply to build in messages to alert the user, and make some minor cosmetic changes.

I was actually surprised that I accomplished as much as I did in a single week, and was helped immensely by working with another person. I wouldn't have thought that I could actually complete this just a few weeks ago, and I found that I thoroughly enjoy the feeling of satisfaction that comes from crafting a working app from scratch.

## Unsolved Problems

All of my gameplay logic and API calls work, and I surprisingly don't have any remaining bugs (or any that I know about after user-testing 150+ games). If I had more time I would make better user-facing messages and refine the color scheme, condense my code and eliminate redundancies, make better modals that pop up on page load, and re-organize my JS files so that my concerns were better differentiated.
